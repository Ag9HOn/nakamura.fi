I'm a people person and have a passion for making IT safely and securely serve people instead of the other way around. I believe cybersecurity is ultimately about protecting people, business, and society, and I wish to be able to make an impact in the society around me.

By education I am a Master of Engineering in Cyber Security and a Bachelor of Engineering in Network Technologies. I am a lifelong learner and have a special interest in international relations, geopolitics, East Asia, and working in international environments. In 2023 this led me to pursue my second masterâ€™s degree in social sciences in the University of Turku, focusing on East Asia with the aim to combine my cybersecurity background with social sciences studies.
