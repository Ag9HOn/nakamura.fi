I was invited to give a presentation in TurkuSec on the new IMO and IACS requirements on cybersecurity for new ship builds. In this video I explain the significance of the IMO/IACS requirements, how Classification Societies create cybersecurity rules for the industry.

Also see my other [article on the subject]( {{< ref "article/2023-02-16-charting-a-course-to-cybersecurity/index.md" >}}) and the [TurkuSec website](https://turkusec.fi/) for more events.
