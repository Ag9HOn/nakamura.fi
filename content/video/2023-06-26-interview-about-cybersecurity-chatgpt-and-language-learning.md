I spent March in 2023 in Taipei learning Mandarin Chinese and while there I was interviewed for the LTL school podcast. See the the video for a discussion I had with Rushi from LTL Language School about everyday cybersecurity, ChatGPT, and my experiences learning Mandarin Chinese!

Before the interview I thought a lot about what I wanted to say about language learning and I wasn’t expecting questions about cybersecurity, so in addition to botnets preying on our WiFi routers and the big tech companies collecting and selling our personal information, I didn’t realize to bring up probably the scariest reason for worrying about our personal information and taking good care of our cyber hygiene: identity theft.
