      <description>I was invited to give a presentation in TurkuSec on the new IMO and IACS requirements on cybersecurity for new ship builds. In this video I explain the significance of the IMO/IACS requirements, how Classification Societies create cybersecurity rules for the industry.
Also see my other article on the subject and the TurkuSec website for more events.</description>

      <description>Over the last year I have participated in quite many discussions about cyber security in maritime industry. There is a trend of growing number of cyber attacks in the industry, which have caused lots of disruptions and financial losses for companies and organizations. The shipping industry is also particularly vulnerable to these threats due to the long service lives of onboard systems, growing use of cloud-based solutions by equipment manufacturers and shipowners both in new constructions and also as additions to in-service vessels to enable remote maintenance and collection of data.</description>
