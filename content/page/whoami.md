I currently work as a Cyber Security Manager, where I dedicate myself to enhancing our cyber security measures. I have a robust technical background, enriched by a Master of Engineering in Cyber Security and a Bachelor of Engineering in Network Technologies. Despite this strong technical foundation, I consider myself first and foremost a people person. My passion lies not just in understanding technology, but also in shaping it to serve people safely and securely.

Apart from my professional interests, I'm passionate about language learning, a pursuit that complements my fascination with international relations. I find East Asia especially captivating, and I strive to understand its unique cybersecurity challenges and opportunities.

As a professional, I abide by several guiding principles. I strongly advocate for continuous learning, clear communication, and cross-cultural collaboration. In all my relationships, I strive to foster trust and empathy, affirming the role of technology as a tool for serving people responsibly.
